========
You can use and modify the font according to the license. 
We decided to release it as a “Libre” font because we think that it’s useless to give a single solution to a specific problem.

If you have any suggestion or specific needs, please write us, we’ll be glad to have advices to expand the font or your personal customizations. 
The practice of Design for All “requires the involvement of end users at every stage in the design process”. 
For this reason the font is released as a draft, it will be updated little by little with your help, use it with care.
